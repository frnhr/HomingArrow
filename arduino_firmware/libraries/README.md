# Arduino libraries

These libraries need to be installed in Arduino IDE before this code can be compiled.
Since version 1.0.5, Arduino IDE provides a simple menu command to import .zip library, see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4

For convenicence, current versions of required libraries (as of 2015-08-23) are included here. HomingArrow has been tested with these versions. Upgrading might be a good idea, but might also introduce breaking changes, so use judgement when doing so.

List of required libraries:

 * [`Adafruit_Sensor 1.0.2`] [1]
 * [`Adafruit_HMC5883_Unified 1.0.0`] [2]
 * [`Adafruit-GPS-Library 1.0.0`] [3]
